"""Base module, collects all possible imports.

*"Do everything with famous laconic brevity!"*

A Python web framework (both Python 2 and 3, though 2 not yet supported)
that aims to make writting REST APIs in Python as fast and simple as it can
possibly get.

It tries to accomplish that by making otherwise repetitive and laborious tasks,
such as parsing request parameters, authentication, database communication,
response generation etc., into beautiful and expressive one-liners, which are
extremely simple to write and understand.
